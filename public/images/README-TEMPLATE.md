⚠️ Template image needs to be added manually

## Steps:

   `vote-template.png`

2. Place it in this directory:
   `/Users/rameshkumar/Document/App/Opinion Pole/public/images/`

3. The template should be the FIRST image you uploaded (with blank/placeholder text in the blue box)

4. After adding, commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add public/images/vote-template.png
   git commit -m "Add vote confirmation template"
