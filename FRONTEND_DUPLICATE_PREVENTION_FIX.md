# Fix: Frontend Duplicate Vote Prevention Now Respects Settings

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The frontend was **always** checking `localStorage` for duplicate votes, regardless of the backend setting. Now it properly respects the `duplicate_vote_prevention` setting.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### VotingPage.tsx Updates:

1. **Added System Settings State**:
   - Fetches settings from `/api/settings/public` on page load
   - Stores in component state

2. **Updated Vote Checks**:
   - `handleCandidateSelectAndSubmit()` - Now checks setting before blocking
   - `handleSubmit()` - Now checks setting before blocking
   - `localStorage.setItem('hasVoted')` - Only sets if prevention is enabled

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Your Browser's Previous Vote Record
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('hasVoted')
localStorage.removeItem('lastVote')
```

### Step 2: Verify Settings Are Disabled
In admin dashboard, ensure these are **OFF (gray)**:
- ✗ Duplicate Vote Prevention (disabled)
- ✗ Anonymous Voting (disabled)  
- ✗ 48-Hour Blackout Period (disabled)

### Step 3: Try Voting Multiple Times
1. Go to `/vote`
2. Select district, constituency, candidate
3. Click "वोट दें" (Vote)
4. Should redirect to confirmation page
5. Go back to `/vote` and vote again
6. **Expected**: Should allow voting again without error

### Step 4: Enable Duplicate Prevention
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Toggle "Duplicate Vote Prevention" **ON (green)**
3. Try voting again
4. **Expected**: Should block with "आप पहले ही मतदान कर चुके हैं"

## 🔍 How It Works Now

### When Duplicate Prevention is **ENABLED** (default):
```
Frontend Check: localStorage.getItem('hasVoted')
  ↓ (if exists)
Show Error: "आप पहले ही मतदान कर चुके हैं"
  ↓ (if not exists)
Backend Check: fingerprint_hash + ip_address in database
  ↓ (if exists)
Return 409: "You have already voted"
  ↓ (if not exists)
Allow Vote → Set localStorage.setItem('hasVoted', 'true')
```

### When Duplicate Prevention is **DISABLED**:
```
Frontend Check: SKIP (setting disabled)
  ↓
Backend Check: SKIP (setting disabled)
  ↓
Allow Vote → DO NOT set localStorage flag
  ↓
User can vote unlimited times
```

## 🚨 Important Note

**You currently have `hasVoted` in your browser's localStorage** from a previous vote. This is why you're seeing "आप पहले ही मतदान कर चुके हैं" even though the setting is disabled.

**Solution**: Clear your browser's localStorage as shown in Step 1 above.

---

## 📊 Current Flow

1. **Page Load** → Fetch system settings from `/api/settings/public`
2. **Select Candidate** → Check if `systemSettings.duplicate_vote_prevention === true`
3. **If True**: Check localStorage and backend
4. **If False**: Skip all checks, allow vote
5. **After Vote**: Only set localStorage if prevention is enabled
