## 🎨 Recommended Approach: Path-Based URLs

### Structure:
```
opinionpoll.co.in/              → Generic landing
opinionpoll.co.in/states        → State selection
opinionpoll.co.in/bihar/        → Bihar landing (existing content)
opinionpoll.co.in/bihar/vote    → Bihar voting
opinionpoll.co.in/bihar/results → Bihar results
opinionpoll.co.in/bihar/blog/   → Bihar blogs
opinionpoll.co.in/maharashtra/  → Maharashtra (new)
opinionpoll.co.in/jharkhand/    → Jharkhand (new)
```

### Why Path-Based?
✅ **Single domain** (stronger overall authority)  
✅ **Easier internal linking** (cross-state)  
✅ **Simpler to manage** (one SSL, one hosting)  
✅ **Better for branding** (opinionpoll.co.in recognized)  
✅ **Lower cost** (no subdomains needed)  

### 301 Redirects (Critical!):
```
/vote → /bihar/vote (301)
/results → /bihar/results (301)
/blog/bihar-* → /bihar/blog/* (301)
```

These redirects preserve your hard-earned SEO juice!
